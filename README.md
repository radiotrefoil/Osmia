A website that you can use to query OSM data from a temporal perspective. OSM data is colour-coded by when it was last edited, allowing you to detect areas that have not been updated for a long time. Currently focused on the `highway` network such as roads and pathways but you can easily change it to whatever key/tag you want. Check out the deployment at my Github Pages site: https://radiotrefoil.github.io/Osmia/
